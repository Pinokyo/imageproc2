# Image Processing Example 

I developed a MATLAB function color_extract that extracts the regions with different colors from the input image “hw3.jpg” using a color model different than RGB. The requests from us are as follows:
 
▪ The function should display original image and also six images in which each region with different color is preserved and the other parts of the image are replaced with gray intensity. 
 
▪ A sample output is provided below. You may also test your code on other color images to observe the result.
